Code The Change Members Application
===================================

v1.0

This is a project I made for my application to Code The Change Berkeley. The application is written in an
MVC Framework. It is an app that  that reads contact and biographical data about members in Code The Change
and displays them onto an iOS user interface. The application also gives the ability to access each member's
facebook, LinkedIn, and GitHub profile. It also allows them to send emails from the phone to each member.

Note #1: I did not have all the contact data for each member in the .csv file. As a result, if you run the file,
you should be able to access all the functionality for three people: Abhishek Fatehpuria (me), Michael Lannin (I
know him from Net Impact——I'm not a stalker :P), and my girlfriend. In order to do this, I added data to the CSV
file and added  data about the Facebook, LinkedIn, Github, and email URLs.

Note #2: If you do not have xCode on your computer, I have included a folder of screenshots in this
repository so you can still get a sense for how the code functions. However, I would really hope that you will run
the program on the iOS simulator from xCode! This application is optimally designed for a 4 inch iPhone with iOS 7.
While it will work on a 3.5 inch screen, I highly advise using the 4 inch retina emulator from xCode when running the
application.

PS: I made this iPhone app instead of making a webpage because I really wanted to brush up on my Mobile
development skills, as I last worked with Objective-C last summer. To take a look at some of my other projects,
